**Humor Level:** Minimalâ€”dry wit surfaces in character interactions (e.g., flirtatious advances), but the focus remains on sharp dialogue and atmospheric allure.  

**Sentence Rhythm:** Fluid and varied, mixing lyrical descriptions ("Her long, flowing hair danced in the sea breeze") with brisk, impactful lines ("SCREEECH! CRASH!"). Pacing escalates dramatically during the crash, heightening tension.
